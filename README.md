The selenium2 demo for eshop insite search
----------------------
Maven+TestNG+Selenium2(Webdriver)  
  
In order to run the project in eclipse:  
1. Install firefox (no driver installation required; if you don't wanna check the procedure, you can use HtmlUnitDriver instead of FireFoxDriver)  
2. TestNG plugin for eclipse (http://beust.com/eclipse).  
3. Maven project update to download the jars  
4. If unlucky, setup the firefox profile with license for https (I haven't tested this)
